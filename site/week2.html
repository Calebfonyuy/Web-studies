		<h1>Introduction to CSS3</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>In this week, we introduce the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS3). We will look at a brief introduction to this alongside the concept of <b>selectors</b> in HTML and the usage of the stylesheets to format web pages.</p>

		<h2>Notes</h2>
		<ol>
			<li><h4>Selectors</h4></li>
			Selectors in HTML refer to elements that can be used to reference a particular section of the page in order to apply styles to it. The main selectors used in HTML include:
			<ul>
				<li>HTML elements: By this we refer to the element associated with the tag we are targetting. Any formatting defined for a given element will be applied to all areas where the associated tag is use.</li>
				<li>Class: The class of a given section in a HTML is usually set as an attribute of a tag and written as part of the opening tag. For example: <xmp> <htmltag class="test-class">sample test for htmltag </htmltag></xmp> The class name can be reused with several tags so as to apply similar formatting to these sections.</li>
				<li>ID: This selector is used to uniquely reference a particular section of the page. It is useful when we desire to apply a specific formatting to a certain section of our page. The HTML id attribute is declared exactly like the class attribute with the class keyword replaced by <b>id</b>.</li>
			</ul>
			<li><h4>Defining styles</h4></li>
			The format for defining a style in stylesheets is as follows:<xmp>
			selector{
				style-name: value;
				<!-- Other styles can be found here-->
			}
			</xmp>
			It should be noted that a particular style defination can contain numerous styles but on the condition that they are distinct.
			<p>When writing your code, the best practice is to place all the styles inside the style tag in usually placed in the head of the html document.</p>
			<p>The format for defining a style using a HTML element as selector is as follows:<xmp>
			element {
				style-name: value;
				<!-- Other styles may be defined here -->
			}
			</xmp></p>
			To define the style using a class as selector, the format is as follows:<xmp>
			.class-name {
				style-name: value;
				<!-- Other styles may be defined here -->
			}
			</xmp> In the above illustration, it should be noted that the name of the class does not contain the leading point. That is, the name of the class is <em>class-name</em> but the point is added to indicate that we are selecting a class.</p>
			<p>For style definition using the id attribute, we have the following format:<xmp>
			#id {
				style-name: value;
				<!-- Other styles may be defined here -->
			}
			</xmp></p>
			In the above notation just like in the class definition, the id is actually <em>id</em>. The # only indicates the fact that our selector is an id attribute.
			<li><h4>Combining selectors</h4></li>
			<p>Several selectors can be used together especially when it comes to using elements as selectors. However, it is needless to combine id attributes since the latter are specific.</p>
			<p>It is also possible to define a style for several selectors. In such a situation, we write all the selectors before the selectors before the opening curly bracket separated by commas.</p>
