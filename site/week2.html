		<p>In this week, we introduce the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS3). We will look at a brief introduction to this alongside the concept of <b>selectors</b> in HTML and the usage of the stylesheets to format web pages.</p>

		<h2>Notes</h2>
		<ol>
			<li><h4>Selectors</h4>
			<img src="selector.png" height="150px" width="150px" align="right">Selectors in HTML refer to elements that can be used to reference a particular section of the page in order to apply styles to it. The main selectors used in HTML include:
			<ul>
				<li>HTML elements: By this we refer to the element associated with the tag we are targetting. Any formatting defined for a given element will be applied to all areas where the associated tag is use.</li>
				<li>Class: The class of a given section in a HTML is usually set as an attribute of a tag and written as part of the opening tag. For example: <xmp> <htmltag class="test-class">sample test for htmltag </htmltag></xmp> The class name can be reused with several tags so as to apply similar formatting to these sections.</li>
				<li>ID: This selector is used to uniquely reference a particular section of the page. It is useful when we desire to apply a specific formatting to a certain section of our page. The HTML id attribute is declared exactly like the class attribute with the class keyword replaced by <b>id</b>.</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li><h4>Combining selectors</h4>
			<p><img src="combination.jpeg" height="150px" width="150px" align="right">Several selectors can be used together especially when it comes to using elements as selectors. However, it is needless to combine id attributes since the latter are specific.</p>
			<p>It is also possible to define a style for several selectors. In such a situation, we write all the selectors before the selectors before the opening curly bracket separated by commas.</p></li>
			<li><h4>Defining styles</h4>
			<img src="style.jpeg" height="150px" width="150px" align="right">The format for defining a style in stylesheets is as follows:<xmp>
selector{
	style-name: value;
	<!-- Other styles can be found here-->
}
			</xmp>
			It should be noted that a particular style defination can contain numerous styles but on the condition that they are distinct.
			<p>When writing your code, it is good to place all the styles inside the style tag in usually placed in the head of the html document. This method is however only good for testing purposes. The best thing to do is to create an external file of extension <b>.css</b> and then add a link to it in the head of the file as follows: <xmp><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="file-name.css"></xmp></p>
			<p>The format for defining a style using a HTML element as selector is as follows:<xmp>
element {
	style-name: value;
	<!-- Other styles may be defined here -->
}
			</xmp></p>
			To define the style using a class as selector, the format is as follows:<xmp>
.class-name {
	style-name: value;
	<!-- Other styles may be defined here -->
}
			</xmp> In the above illustration, it should be noted that the name of the class does not contain the leading point. That is, the name of the class is <em>class-name</em> but the point is added to indicate that we are selecting a class.</p>
			<p>For style definition using the id attribute, we have the following format:<xmp>
#id {
	style-name: value;
	<!-- Other styles may be defined here -->
}
			</xmp></p>
			In the above notation just like in the class definition, the id is actually <em>id</em>. The # only indicates the fact that our selector is an id attribute.</li>
