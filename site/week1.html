					<h3>What is HTML?</h3>
					<p>HTML stands for <em>HyperText Markup Language</em>. It is mainly used to define the structure and content of web pages. HTML on its own does not really give us any fancy looking pages (an example is this one lol). It is often combined with Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) and JavaScript to obtain the great and interactive pages we get to use each day.</p>
					<p>HTML is currently being developed by the <em>W3C</em> and <em>WHATWG</em>. The main interest of the W3C is to define standards for HTML as well as HTML versions while the WHATWG takes care of define what can or cannot be done with HTML.</p>

					<h3>History of HTML</h3>
					<p>I will simply give some highlights here about the history of HTML and then direct you to websites that have the complete and rich history.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>HTML was developed by <b>Tim Berners-Lee</b> between 1989 and 1990. He wrote the browser and server for this in late 1990 and by 1991 published a document on HTML tags defining 18 elements.</li>
						<li>Between 1991 and 1997, several people took up HTML developement and kept pushing the limits of this field. However, within this period, there were no standards and browsers simply operated according to the desires of their developers. This led to the invention of tags and other situations like different browsers interpreting the same tag differently.</li>
						<li>In 1997, the <b>World Wide Web Consortium(W3C)</b> came up with the first standards for HTML which defined a new version of it <b>HTML4</b> which was later developed to get <b>HTML4.01</b> and subsequently other versions like <b>XHTML</b></li>
						<li>Feeling that the development by the W3C was too slow, browser vendors came together to form the <b>Web Hypertext Application Technology Group (WHATWG)</b>. This group is in charge of the evolution of HTML but not the versioning.</li>

					<h3>HTML elements and tags</h3>
					<h4>HTML tags</h4>
					<p>A tag in html is simply a keyword defining a particular function written between angular bracket. Some examples include <xmp> <p> for paragraph, <b> for bold and <i> for italics</xmp></p>
					<p>HTML defines both opening and closing tags. An opening tag simply appears like the tags listed above while for a closing tag we insert a backslash between the first angular bracket and the tag identity. Examples include <xmp> </b>, </i> etc </xmp></p>
					<p>It should however be noted that some tags do not have closing tags. Examples are <xmp> <input>, <br> </xmp> </p>
					<h4>HTML elements</h4>
					An HTML element is a combination of an opening and a closing tag seperated by the content to which the formatting is being applied. They have the following appearance <xmp> <p> Paragraph content here </p></xmp>

		<p>In order to illustrate the fact that HTML is mainly used for the structure of the page, this page has been intensionally left void of CSS code. As from week 2, we shall start presenting pages containing CSS code in order to make the difference between these pages to be felt more strongly.</p>
